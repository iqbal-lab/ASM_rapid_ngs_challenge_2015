Started cortex indep pipeline on ASM and background, Wed Sep 16 15:11:03 BST 2015


16 September 1500, started indep workflow on 2600 samples of Salmonella.

By 17th September 17.08,we had called variants on 2600 samples (ASM+background) and had found 272,380 SNPs in total.
ie we had run indep pipeline up to combine step.

By 10am on Friday 18th Sept, had dumped a VCF per sample at the union-set of sites for salmonella.
Now we need to combine these into one megaVCF - just adding columns basically.
